# Naive Bayes

This machine learning tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the Naive Bayes Classifier, a powerful technique used for pattern detection and prediction. This tutorial will encompass an overview of the learning objectives, a dedicated section detailing the prerequisites for completing the tutorial, and a guide on best practices for Research Data Management (RDM).

The tutorial revisits the Iris flower dataset to introduce the basic steps of working with the Naive Bayes Classifier. It then applies the classifier to detect spam in SMS messages using the SMS Spam collection dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and performs multi-label classification using the CMU book dataset. The tutorial also presents a scenario where the Naive Bayes Classifier fails, providing an explanation for the failure. By the end of this tutorial, participants will have a solid understanding of the Naive Bayes classifier, be able to split data into training and testing sets, make predictions, evaluate classifier performance, identify spam, classify books, train a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier for single or multiple labels, and utilize imputation techniques for handling missing data.
